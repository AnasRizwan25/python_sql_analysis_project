![Kaggle, Python, SQL flow diagram](./img/data%20analysis%20pic.PNG)


This project is an end-to-end data analytics pipeline built using Python and SQL. It downloads data from Kaggle, cleans and transforms it, loads it into a SQL database, and then performs analysis with visualizations.

## What It Does

- Download Data: Automatically retrieves datasets using the Kaggle API.
- Clean & Transform: Processes raw data to ensure quality.
- Load to Database: Inserts cleaned data into a SQL database.
- Analyze & Visualize: Runs SQL queries and creates charts for insights.

## Tech Stack

- Python: Data processing with Pandas.
- SQL: Data storage and querying.
- Kaggle API: For automated dataset retrieval.


## Dataset

The project uses a dataset available on Kaggle. You can check it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders.
